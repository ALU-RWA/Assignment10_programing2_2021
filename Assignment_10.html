<h1>Assignment 10 Instructions</h1>

Welcome to assignment 10 <br>
We are about to finish our projects so Congratulations on all the work that you have done so far :)<br>
In this one, we are testing our ability to package our applications well for future distribution to our users.<br>
Remember, if there is anything here that you don't quite understand, please ask me, anything at all :) <br>

<h2>Question</h2>
In this assignment you are tasked to finish up your applications <br>
Put in all the necessary event handling and package your application into a runnable jar.<br>
For those making websites, this is a time fo finish up all the work that you haven't, incorporating feedback from assignment 8<br>

Also you need to provide a shortcut to your runnable jar with a different image other than
the default java one<br>

<h3>Grading Rubric</h3>
This question is worth 100 marks <br>
Your code running perfectly is worth 50 marks, if your code does not run -20<br>
Packaging your code into a runnable jar is worth 15 marks <br>
A small video of you interacting with your application and showing how it works 15 marks<br>
A nice shortcut to your runnable jar with a different icon image than the default java cup 5 marks <br>
A well documented read me that talks about your project , project configuration<br>
(external libraries and everything that someone will need to run your code ),
nice commenting and authors on the top of every file 5 marks <br>

<h3>Attention</h3>
Here are a few things that can make you lose marks, please make sure that you note these things well :)<br>
If there is no author on the top of every page, that is -5, for every page that does not have an author on the top.<br>
If your read me does not describe in short what your project does,
and does not have the names of people in the group, that is -5 <br>
Remember to keep your code, well organized, well commented and clean.<br><br>
And remember to put instructions on how to run your project in the read me <br>
